    <h1>BLOCK Element!!!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>A Block level element, by default, takes up all the space to the right and to the left, internal to its parent</li>
        <li>A BLOCK CAN have height and width</li>
        <li>NOTHING can ever be on either side (internal to the parent) because its 100%. If you change the width, it will just add margin.
            Blocks will ignore margin you add, because they're already 100%</li>
        <li>Can be > 100%</li>
    </ol>

            <div id="block1" class="block"></div>

            <div id="block3" class="block"></div>
        </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Respect left and right padding, left and right margin
        but will ignore top and bottom,</li>
        <li>Couldn't care less what is left or right.</li>
        <li>With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline
        element how big to be.</li>
        <li>Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so.</li>
